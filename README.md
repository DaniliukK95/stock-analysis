#Stock analysis
Challenge 2 assignment. 

##Overview
###Background
Steve recently graduated with a finance degree! His parents being passionate about green energy decided to invest in the stock ticker “DQ”. Steve, being the caring son that he is, wants to look further into their investment along with other potential investments that can fit their portfolio. Steve has come to us to analyze a handful of energy stocks including “DQ”. In module 2 we wrote code in VBA to automate analysis for any stock in the data set. By the end of module 2, we created a VBA script that analyzes the information for the years 2017 and 2018 of the 12 stocks we have in the data set. Although great for our data set, what if we wanted to do the entire stock market over more than 2 years? The code we have already created might not be sufficient. 
###Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to edit/refactor our original code to take fewer steps overall, use less memory, increase code performance, and improve the logic of the code for digestible reading. This will make the code more efficient in many areas. We will analyze the performance of the stocks to each other, and between the 2 years. We will also compare our old VBA script to the new one based on run time after refactoring.
